                <ul>
                    <li> Looks mostly like a normal lion of the present day
                    </li>
                    <li> It has special skin, it changes color depending on what it is doing
                    </li>
                    <li> It received these special characteristics when it was revived</li>
                    <li>It is no longer the lion it was once
                    </li>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Elementa Lionis?</span>
                After going through an extensive revitalization process in order to conserve their species 
                in a post-apocalyptic world, the lion developed a special skin that changes over time, and 
                changes further when it is interacted with. We don’t know too much about why it turned out this way, 
                but it is definitely better than having the lion go fully extinct.

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> When the lion is being pet by placing 
                the mouse on its head and body, it purrs and moves excitedly. It can be fed, it moves towards food, and turns pink when it eats! 
                You can also play with its favorite toy ball, in which it turns a whole new color when it’s happy.
